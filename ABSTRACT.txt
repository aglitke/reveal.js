As kubernetes clusters take on more workloads, the need for persistent storage has only increased.  Users want to connect more storage 
devices and use them efficiently.  Cinder has been solving this use case in Openstack for a long time and can be integrated with any 
kubernetes cluster regardless of its cloud provider.  By deploying a standalone cinder service and a new external provisioner to a 
cluster, pods can access almost any volume that cinder is able to provision.  Complex operations such as cloning, snapshots, and 
migration become services of the cluster.  This presentation will describe and demonstrate a cinder external provisioner, enumerate 
its advantages, discuss challenges especially around deployment, and propose collaboration opportunities between Openstack and 
kubernetes.
